# ChatGPTCopilot-Npp
This is a simple Notepad++ plugin which adds OpenAI API to Notepad++, specifcally for helping to write code.

Based on the plugin template found here: https://github.com/kbilsted/NotepadPlusPlusPluginPack.Net

This plugin may have bugs - it was written in a short period of time without much polishing!


# How to use
1. Fill in your API key in the settings page
2. Choose your model on the settings page (currently, only the chat GPT models have been tested by me)
3. On the main Copilot page, enter a prompt and press Send to get a response from your chosen GPT model
4. Highlight text before pressing Send to have the selected code refactored by chatGPT. Note that this will replace the highlighted code with code written by chatGPT!
